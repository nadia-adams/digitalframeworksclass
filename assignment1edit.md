*Story Ideas*

Declining prison population: How much has the prison population gone down in the last year?  
The United States has one of the highest prison populations among developed countries. Due to state and federal laws the prison population increased significantly over the last 40 years. Black and Hispanic populations are disproportionately incarcerated. In recent years prison population reform has gained attention to push back on harsh sentencing, non-violent crimes, racial bias and marijuana convictions. Marijuana has become legal in 11 states prompting reform for inmates convicted of possession of marijuana. States known for harsh sentencing and conditions should be looked at. Rikers Island in New York and California State Penitentiary can be looked at for its population and retention rates. 


Land-ownership among African-Americans: Has land ownership among African-Americans increased or decreased in the last year? 
Landownership can be a source of wealth. With an increasing wealth gap between black and white Americans, landownership can be a source of reasoning. When slaves were freed in 1863, they were promised some land from the United States but never received it. Though some slaves inherited land from slave holders and abolitionist. Inherited land or air property held by blacks today has been mostly sold or confiscated by large corporations. Furthermore, throughout the Jim Crow era blacks were not allowed to own or purchase land in certain areas. Economically, this has set African-Americans back but where do we stand today? 

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy: Land Ownership

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 5
   * What was it? Whites own majority of the land in the U.S. while blacks as a whole own less than one percent of that land.
   * Was it in the headline? Yes.
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent 4
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? Yes. 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? Smaller paragraphs and more graphics. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate 4.5
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. None.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. None.
   * Did they provide a source? USDA, Government laws. 
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? Yes. 

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) 4
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. It's colorful, simple to read, but they can break it down into smaller graphics.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? I think so. 
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together? Yes.
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? Yes.
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue? Yes.
* Type (1-5)3 
   * Explain The font was small but needs to be bigger. 
* Color (1-5) 5
   * Explain Easy to identify variables and graphic elements. 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? Somewhat.
   * How? They were simple graphics but they have interactive components.
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. 4

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy: Prison Population

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 5
   * What was it? It was really a report on county jails. 
   * Was it in the headline? Yes. 
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? 5 Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? It was a lot of sentence form structure. 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? It seems pretty straight forward. 
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 4 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. Not all jails and officials were accounted for. Some information was rounded. 
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. This is directly from the U.S. dept. of justice. 
   * Did they provide a source? Bureau of Justice statistics. 
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? Yes. 

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) 5
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. They provided definitions to words and information context.
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? Yes. 
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)2
   * Explain It wasn't eyecatching or appealing. 
* Color (1-5)3
   * Explain Though it had color it wasn't enough. 
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? No. 
   * How?It was a government report so it wasn't creative just laying the facts out. 
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. 4
