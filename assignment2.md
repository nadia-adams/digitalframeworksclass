## Black Land ownership in the 21st Century: Who is the 1% of black landowners? ## 

95% of land owners are white and only 1% of the land owners in America are black/African American. This contributes to the wealth gap in America. Due to legal and systematic policy reasons overtime land ownership among blacks has decreased signifigantly over the last century. I want to explore who these remaining land owners are and possibly how they were able to retain this land. Using this data to see where policy imporvements can be made to protect black land ownership. 

Here are the data points I want to collect: What regions have the most black land owners? Due to policies that prevented land ownership in certain areas it is important to understand where these landowners are. How many acres do they have?  How much do they own and what do they do with it. Age/Gender? More details about who they are and if there are any inequalities. I collect the data by contacting land preservation groups and information from USDA.gov. WIth this information I'll find the median age, acreage, ect.
