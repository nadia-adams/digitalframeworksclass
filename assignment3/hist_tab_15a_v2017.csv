"*Housing inventory estimates from 2000 through 2009 are revised based on Vintage 2010 estimates. Housing inventory estimates from 2010 through 2018 are based on the latest set of independent housing unit estimates, Vintage 2017, produced annually by the Census Bureau's Population Division. These annual estimates are updated using building permits, estimates of housing loss and administrative records data. Vacancy rates and homeownership rates are not affected by this revision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This time series is by the latest ""Vintage"" year. For example, Vintage 2017 means that all of the estimates in this time series are identified as belonging to ""Vintage 2017."" The 2010 data are from the 2017 vintage, the 2011 data are from the 2017 vintage, and so on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
