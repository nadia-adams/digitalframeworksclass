## Data Cleaning Steps  
1. I took out the unnecessary wording like, United States, family groupings, revisings. 
2. Arranged the data by year and age range on the x axis. 
3. Arranged the family groupings, totals, and owners on the y axis. 
4. I kept the two columns (total,owner) instead of just keeping the owner column.
5. I kept the raw numbers instead of changing them to percentages. It reads better. 
6. I kept the age ranges. 
7. I copied and paste the raw numbers. 
8. I kept the most recent years (2008-2018) instead of 2000 to present. I felt like these would be more accurate.
