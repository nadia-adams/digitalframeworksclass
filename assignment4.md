How much will Maryland black homeownership grow in 4 years and by whom will it grow?  

Weâ€™re going into a new decade and we need to check how our demographics are doing after years of dealing with the same issues. Secondly our president has made statements about Baltimore and predominately black neighborhoods that have more depth than just symptoms of what we see. Thirdly, the 2020 elections and highlighting the real conditions of economic conditions of black voters. 
I plan on gathering information from Sources that are actual black Maryland homeowners. To talk about their home owning experience. Some questions I can ask are when did you become a homeowner? How much were you able to put down on a house payment?  How many black neighbors do you have? I can also talk to some realtors and housing officials. I need to figure out who will be the best people to reach out to. 
The data sources I plan on using are the U.S. Census, Maryland Housing Authority Information, Pew Research, National Association of Realtors, Zillow Research, RedFin, and Maryland realtors. 
The data I would like to visualize are housing locations for neighborhoods that have the highest and lowest black homeowners. Homeowner age and gender.
