# The Other 1%: Black farmers finding hope after leaving corporate 
### By: Nadia Adams

Gale Livingstone, 46, has been farming since 2012. She worked as a consultant for 20 years in the D.C.  before going after a passion of hers. Gardening. A few years ago one of her friends bought a place in West Virginia and Gale moved to WV to practice gardening. She continued to commute for work. She said it took about three years before she became a farmer full time. Her specialty is growing air loom tomatoes but currently she is still leasing the property she is farming on.
   
Gale says one of the challenges she’s dealing with is finding an affordable property with at least 20 acres and a house on it. Loan restrictions for minority farmers are another hurdle in obtaining property ownership. Gale says, loan approvals could take anywhere from 90 days to six months. Loan programs for minority farmers used to be set at a maximum of $300,000 for loans but now they have loans for upwards of $600,000. Livingstone is hoping for success in her loan approval process. 

Gale says farming gives you a sense of self-gratification but it presents more challenges than rewards. “It’s very hard to find people to do the work…there are a lot of hurdles to get over,” says Gale.  Livingstone has applied to the DuPont farmers market but hasn’t been accepted yet. She says it’s very competitive to break into large markets. 

“If anyone wants to get into farming they should try it part-time first… then get into it full-time,” says Livingstone.

According to the USDA 2017 Agriculture Census, 229 black farmers owned 2000 acres or more of land. Over 30,000 black farmers are full owners of agricultural properties. They are a part of the one percent of blacks that own land in the United States.For most black farmers only one person is the sole producer for the farm. Like Gale, she is one of almost 4,000 black farmers who are tenants on their farms. As of 2017, there are over 45,000 black producers.  Almost half of them are in the, “beef cattle ranching and farming,” category. On the other side many black farmers are produce growers. 

Solomon Lincoln, 36, has been working in farming sales for one year now. His specialty is growing watercress, an aquaponics plant. Lincoln, was a communication major and worked at Wells Fargo for a number of years. Then one fateful day changed his life. He was hit by a tractor trailer and suffered severe traumatic injuries. About a month after he got out of the hospital, Solomon decided he could not go back into banking because of the work environment. Sitting for long hours at a computer desk could not help him heal. 

Solomon happened to stumble upon a local farm stead and thereafter he started working there. Lincoln says it’s great to have access to a local market. He says the positive relationships, and the technology to do the job, are just some of the benefits. “Farming is very different from working in a corporate workspace,” says Lincoln. There are no breaks and it is physically demanding, but he says there are different ways of being a part of agriculture. 

His suggestion to people who are living in the city and are suffering from food deserts is to, “…move out of the city and support your local farmers.”  He says he rarely goes to the grocery store because he has access to everything that he needs from the farm to the table. 

For over a century black farmers and black land owners have faced challenges to thrive in this industry. Despite these challenges they are taking significant risks to become produce suppliers and break into huge markets. Though they are only 1.3% of farmers in America; black farmers are bringing awareness to how minority communities can eat healthier and participate in to contribution to healthy eating.
